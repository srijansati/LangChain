An income-to-\\npoverty ratio evaluates how close \\na family’s or individual’s income \\nis to their poverty threshold. It \\nmeasures the depth of poverty for \\nthose with incomes below their \\npoverty threshold.\\nIn this brief, the income-to-poverty \\nratio is reported as both a per-\\ncentage and ratio. For example, \\nan income-to-poverty-ratio of \\n125 percent indicates families or \\nindividuals with income equal to \\n1.25 times their poverty threshold, \\nwhile an income-to-poverty ratio \\nof 50 percent identifies families or \\nindividuals with income equal to \\none-half of their poverty threshold. \\nFamilies and individuals identified \\nas in poverty and described in the \\npreceding sections of this brief \\nhad an income-to-poverty ratio of \\nless than 100 percent.\\n14 For more information, refer to  \\n<www.census.gov/geographies/reference-\\nmaps/2010/geo/2010-census-regions-and-\\ndivisions-of-the-united-states.html>.\\nTable 1 for states and Table 2 for'),\n",
